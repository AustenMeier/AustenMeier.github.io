## HELLO WORLD... Welcome to The COURSE! 

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It serves as the backbone of web design and development, enabling the structure and presentation of content on the internet.

This course is designed to introduce you to the basics and then gradually explore more advanced aspects of HTML. Each section will focus on different topics, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of web development using HTML. At the end of this course you will be creating your own custom blog post. Once you have finished this course you will move onto the next course. There is a CSS Course that you will also be taking, and that capstone project will be using css on your HTML blog post.
