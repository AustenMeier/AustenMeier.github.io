## Welcome to Section 1: Learning the HTML Basics and Document Structure

### HTML Editors and Tools

To write HTML, you can use any text editor. However, there are specialized HTML editors that provide features like syntax highlighting and auto-completion to make coding easier. Some popular HTML editors are:

*   Visual Studio Code (You will be using this)
*   Sublime Text
*   Atom

Modern web browsers also have developer tools that allow you to inspect and edit HTML and CSS in real-time. To access these tools, right-click on a webpage and select "Inspect" or press \`F12\`.

### Understanding HTML Attributes

HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. Attributes are always included in the opening tag and usually come in name/value pairs like `name="value"`. The opening tag is the first part of an HTML element, such as `<a href="...">` for a link or `<img src="...">` for an image.

Here's an example:

    <a href="https://uflip.com/">Visit Example</a>
  

In this example, the `href` attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. The closing tag for the link element is `</a>`.

### Commonly Used HTML Tags

Here are some commonly used HTML tags:

*   `<a>`: Defines a hyperlink. The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. Closing tag is `</a>`.
*   `<img>`: Embeds an image. The `src` attribute specifies the path to the image file. This tag is self-closing.
*   `<div>`: Defines a division or section in a document. You will use `<div>` a lot, but if you can substitute it with more specific semantic tags (like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.), it can make your code easier to understand and maintain. Closing tag is `</div>`.
*   `<span>`: Defines a section in a document (inline). Closing tag is `</span>`.

### Inline vs Block Elements

HTML elements are either inline or block-level elements. Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. Block-level elements always start on a new line and take up the full width available.

Examples of inline elements:

*   `<a>`
*   `<span>`
*   `<img>`

Examples of block-level elements:

*   `<div>`: Often used to group other elements together to style them with CSS or manipulate them with JavaScript.
*   `<p>`: Defines a paragraph of text.
*   `<h1> - <h6>`: Define HTML headings, with `<h1>` as the highest (or most important) level and `<h6>` as the lowest.

### Basic Styling with CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages. Even though we'll cover CSS in more detail later, here's a brief introduction on how to apply basic styles.

Example of linking a CSS file:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`

Example of inline CSS:

`<p style="color: blue;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>`

### Self-Closing Tags

Some HTML tags are self-closing and do not have a closing tag. Examples include:

*   `<br>`: Inserts a line break
*   `<img>`: Embeds an image
*   `<input>`: Defines an input field

### Example of Using Semantic Elements

Here's an example of how these elements can be used together in an HTML document:

{% highlight html linenos %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Page Title Here</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <!-- Navigation section -->
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
    <!-- Main content section -->
    <section>
        <h2>Main Content</h2>
        <!-- Article within the main content -->
        <article>
            <h3>Article Title</h3>
            <p>This is the main content of the article.</p>
        </article>
    </section>
    <!-- Sidebar section -->
    <aside>
        <h3>Related Content</h3>
        <p>This is some related content.</p>
    </aside>
    <!-- Footer section -->
    <footer>
        <p>© 2024 My Website</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

### Adding Comments to HTML

Comments in HTML are added as follows and do not appear in the rendered output:

`<!-- This is a comment in HTML -->`

  

### Linking CSS and JavaScript

To make our web pages stylish and interactive, we link CSS and JavaScript files externally:

{% highlight html linenos %}

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
<script src="script.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

### Using HTML Entities

Sometimes we need to use special characters in our text:

To display a less than sign, we write &lt; which appears as <.
To display a greater than sign, we write &gt; which appears as >.
To display an ampersand, we write &amp; which appears as &.
  

### Starting Your First HTML Document

To create an HTML document, start with the following basic structure:

{% highlight html linenos %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Text of your choice</h1>
    <p>Smaller text.</p>
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}


This basic structure includes:

*   `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
*   `<html>`: The root element of an HTML document.
*   `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document, like the title and character set.
*   `<title>`: Sets the title of the webpage, shown in the browser tab.
*   `<body>`: Contains the content of the document, such as text, images, and links.

### Exercise: Create a "Hello World" Web Page

Create a simple HTML document that includes the following elements:

*   A heading with the text "Hello World"
*   A paragraph introducing yourself
*   An image of your choice
*   A hyperlink to your favorite website

<button class="show-example-btn">Show Example</button>
  <pre class="example-code" style="display: none">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Hello World&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My name is [Your Name].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;img src="your-image-url.jpg" alt="A description of the image"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit my favorite website: &lt;a href="https://www.example.com"&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </pre>
